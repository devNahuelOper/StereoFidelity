# Stereo Fidelity
Choose a/some sound-effect(s) and get in on the beat!

# Overview
Stereo Fidelity supplies users with several short, looped backing tracks to choose from, and a wide assortment of sound effects to mix into it. The user will need to gauge the rhythym to determine the best moment(s) to add in the effect(s), in order to maintain fidelity.                                                                                
Using some onomatopoeia, here's an illustration of the concept: Let's say we have a simple beat that goes 'bm bm bm bm'. Say the user wants a dog sound in there -- the aim would be to click the doggie icon right it the moment of any 'bm' (doing so during the spaces between would break the rhythym), and the new beat might be something like 'bm bm bm woof' or 'woof bm bm woof'...it's meant to be fun and silly.
